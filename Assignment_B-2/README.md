# README file for Assignment_B-2.Rmd

The assignement_B-2.Rmd is a log that documented the steps I used for the assignment_B-2. In this assignment, there are four exercises. The codes I used for each part were put together below the subtitles correspondingly.

In exercise 1, I created a package with three functions, and made the "ExtractData" directory also a Git repository
In exercise 2, I created a README rmd file and kniited it to a md file.
In exercise 3, I edit the DESCRIPTION file and import external packages.
In exercise 4, I created tests for the functions.

The required contents include: 
  (v) NAMESPACE
  (v) DESCRIPTION
  (v) README.Rmd (and README.md)
  (v) R/ directory
  (v) tests/ directory
  (v) man/ directory
