# ExtractData

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ExtractData is to extract the interested data in a massive data set (vancouver_trees) for the following analysis.
This package is developed for the data analysis on STAT545B 2021W at UBC.
The purpose is to replace repeated codes in the assignments.
The stored data ("vancouver_trees") is a data set from "datateachr" package.
There are three functions in this package, including 'SubGrpSel', 'TmeDifCal', and 'OutputSum'.
'SubGrpSel' extracts data located in specific locations within a tree dataset.
'TmeDifCal' computes the time lengths information according to a vector including time information and the specified reference date.
'OutputSum' generates a summary of chosen columns for each group.

## Installation

This package is not yet on CRAN, you can download it from this repository on github:

``` {r}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2021/functions-tzuyilu/Assignment_B-2/ExtractData/")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
library(ExtractData)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
# Demonstrating data stored in this package
summary(vancouver_trees)
head(vancouver_trees)

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
